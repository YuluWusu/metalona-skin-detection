## 🌟 Introduction

This project is a web application that provides a **preliminary diagnosis of skin lesions** (such as potential signs of skin cancer) using Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence.

The primary goal is to offer a **quick and accessible screening tool** for users to get an initial reference before seeking professional consultation from certified medical practitioners.

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:** The diagnosis results are for **reference only** and must not replace the advice or clinical diagnosis of a specialized dermatologist.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The application is built upon modern web technologies and advanced AI models:

  * **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla JS for user interaction: `detection.js`).
  * **AI Model (Core Logic):** The system uses a model built upon **YOLO Classification** for lesion classification.
  * **Training Data:** The model was trained using the **ISIC 2019** (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, a globally trusted benchmark for dermoscopic image classification.
  * **Backend (Inference):** A dedicated backend (e.g., Python/Flask/Django) is assumed necessary for handling image uploads and running the actual YOLO model inference, though this aspect is not fully detailed in the provided client-side code.

## ✨ Key Features

  * **Easy Image Upload:** Supports drag-and-drop or file selection for skin images.
  * **AI Classification:** Quick processing using the trained YOLO model to classify the type of skin lesion.
  * **Clear Output:** Displays the input image alongside the classification results and confidence level.
  * **Safety Recommendations:** Provides appropriate warnings and general medical recommendations based on the outcome.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YuluWusu/metalona-skin-detection.git
    cd metalona-skin-detection
    ```

2.  **Run the Frontend:**
    Since the provided code is client-side (HTML/CSS/JS), you can simply open the main file:

      * Open `index.html` (or your main HTML file) in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

3.  **Backend Setup (If applicable):**
    *If your actual diagnosis logic relies on a Python or other server-side environment for the YOLO model, you must include detailed steps here (e.g., dependencies, model loading, and server startup commands).*

## 💡 How to Use

1.  **Upload Image:** Drag and drop your skin lesion image into the input area or click to select a file.
2.  **Verify File:** Ensure the image is successfully loaded (file size limit is typically 5MB).
3.  **Diagnose:** Click the **`BẮT ĐẦU CHẨN ĐOÁN`** (Start Diagnosis) button.
4.  **View Results:** The system will process the image and display the classification result, confidence score, and relevant health recommendations.
